This section should explain, in a readable manner:
    - How your fuzzer works
    - What kinds of bugs your fuzzer can find
    - What improvements can be made to your fuzzer (Be honest. We won't dock
    marks for things you didn't implement. This shows reflection and
    understanding)
    - If you attempts any bonus marks - How your fuzzer achieves these bonus
    marks.
    - It is insufficient if the document merely states "our fuzzer injects
    random values and finds bugs". We want details that show deep
    understanding.
