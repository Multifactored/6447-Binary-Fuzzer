# Open Source Fuzzing Engine | Binary Fuzzer
Developed by @Multifactored, @DionEarle, @jjamme, @mattimmanuel01

This program analyses and tests compiled binaries to determine if a possible vulnerability exists. It performs this through passing in malformed or abnormal input and testing if it crashes, before returning the malformed input used if a crash is made. Input is generated by a sequentual array of techniques including integers and characters that trigger edge cases, manipulating size and data types and a bitflip implementation as inspired by [american fuzzy lop](https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).

It currently supports binaries that take as input:
* Plaintext
* JSON
* XML 
* CSV

## Brief Documentation

/binaries - Contains the sample binaries we tested the project on, separated by language.

/writeup - Contains the actual detailed documentation.

fuzzer - The main python program.
- type_checker.py - checks the type of the binary that's passed in, then redirects it to the appropriate handler
