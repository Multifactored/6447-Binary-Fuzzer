# COMP3900 Major Project | Binary Fuzzer
Developed by @Multifactored, @DionEarle, @jjamme, @mattimmanuel01

This program analyses and tests compiled binaries to determine if a possible vulnerability exists. It performs this through passing in malformed or abnormal input and testing if it crashes, before returning the malformed input used if a crash is made.

It currently supports binaries that take as input:
* Plaintext
* JSON
* XML 
* CSV

## Usage of the Project

Usage: `./fuzzer /path/to/binary /path/to/sampleinput`
